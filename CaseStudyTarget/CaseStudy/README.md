Android Case Study
You have been given control over an Android project that was originally a proof-of-concept project. The original developer of the project has since moved on to a new team, and Target has asked you to turn the project into an application that the company could release to the public.

The goal of the app is to display a list of deals currently offered by Target, and to provide information on those deals. As a POC, the app has a few deals hardcoded in and the code is pretty rough. It is your job to turn this app into something useful!

Requirements
Fix up the deals list to match the mockups shown in mockups. Do your best to match the text sizes, colors, and margins from the mockups. We don't expect your implementation to be pixel-perfect.

Present a new view that displays deal details when a deal is clicked on the list screen. Use the mockups. Again, match text sizes, colors, and margins as best you can.

The deals are currently hardcoded. Use the API at https://api.target.com/mobile_case_study_deals/v1 to grab the real deals to display in the app. Your solution should make use of both of the API endpoints.

Guidelines
For convenience, the project uses libraries like Retrofit, Dagger and Glide. Feel free to add other open source libraries or replace the existing libraries.
Be prepared to answer questions about why you chose any libraries that you add to the project.
This project was only tested minimally during development. There may be bugs in the current implementation.
Imagine that this app will continue to grow after you are done. Consider and be ready to discuss how the following engineering values fit into your chosen solution:
Testability (Make sure the run the existing test suite!)
Reusability
Clean, well organized code
Error handling
Design accuracy on multiple screen sizes
Do your best to follow modern Android conventions.
You have the freedom to take this project in whatever direction you'd like; you can keep as much or as little of the existing code as you'd like. Larger changes such as leveraging Jetpack Compose are also on the table if you believe that's the best way to showcase your talents!
