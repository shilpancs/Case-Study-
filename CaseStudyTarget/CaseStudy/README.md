Android Case Study
You have been given control over an Android project that was originally a proof-of-concept project. The original developer of the project has since moved on to a new team, and Target has asked you to turn the project into an application that the company could release to the public.

The goal of the app is to display a list of deals currently offered by Target, and to provide information on those deals. As a POC, the app has a few deals hardcoded in and the code is pretty rough. It is your job to turn this app into something useful!

Requirements
Fix up the deals list to match the mockups shown in mockups. Do your best to match the text sizes, colors, and margins from the mockups. We don't expect your implementation to be pixel-perfect.

Present a new view that displays deal details when a deal is clicked on the list screen. Use the mockups. Again, match text sizes, colors, and margins as best you can.
